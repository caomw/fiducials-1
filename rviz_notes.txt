These are some RVIZ notes.

===================================================


Create the catkin workspace using:

  http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

On my machine, the workspace is in:

  ~/public_html/projects/catkin_ws

I have already put "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh" at the
end of ~/.bashrc.

From .../catkin_ws, remember to source "devel/setup.bash".

--------------------

The RViz tutorial is at:

  http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers:%20Basic%20Shapes

Before running "catkin_create_pkg" change to .../catkin_ws/src:
Now run:

  catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

Now change to .../catkin_ws/src/using_markers/src/ and retreive
the following file:

  wget https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/visualization_tutorials/trunk/visualization_marker_tutorials/src/basic_shapes.cpp

Now change to .../catkin_ws/src/using_markers and add the following
lines to the end of CMakeLists.txt:

================================================


I have already put "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh" at the
end of ~/.bashrc.

In a separate window run:

  roscore

It will print out some logging information.  Leave this window
alone.

Go to another window.

Create the catkin workspace by reading the tutorial at:

  http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

There is not much to it.

On my machine, the workspace is in:

  ~/public_html/projects/catkin_ws

From .../catkin_ws, remember to

  source "devel/setup.bash".

--------------------

Now bring up the RViz tutorial at:

  http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers:%20Basic%20Shapes

Before running "catkin_create_pkg" change to .../catkin_ws/src:
Now run:

  catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

Now change to .../catkin_ws/src/using_markers/src/ and retreive
the following file:

  wget https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/visualization_tutorials/trunk/visualization_marker_tutorials/src/basic_shapes.cpp

Now change to .../catkin_ws/src/using_markers and add the following
lines to the end of CMakeLists.txt:

  add_executable(basic_shapes src/basic_shapes.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(basic_shapes ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

Now change to  .../catkin_ws and type:

  catkin_make

Just in case:

  source devel/setup.bash

Now run everything:

  rosrun using_markers basic_shapes    # using_markers = package;
                                        # basic shapes = program?

---------------

In a third window run the following:

  rosmake rviz

It printed out a whole bunch of missing Makefiles, but it seemed not
to matter that much.

Now run rviz using:

  rosrun rviz rviz

Now edit the line at the time from "/something_I_do_not_remember" to
"/my_frame".

Click on [Add] and select "Markers"

If your graphics accelerator is working (my toshiba is not working,
but my ATI is), intersting shapes should come up.
